Some warnings about the story: I don’t know if you're a horror person, but there is death and some
vivid descriptions of it, so I figured I would warn you.
If you wish to avoid these descriptions, follow these steps: 
if the robot is at your home, do not fight it, do not ask if it’s a robot, and do not run away if it's angry at you. 
That should keep the descriptions to a minimum. 
If I had a little more time I would have added a “less gore” setting at the start.
Other than that, general warnings: Player death, murder(commited by you), terminal illness, 
death of an animal (a chicken)
